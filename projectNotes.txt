- Figured out how to parse inbox object to identify strings (aka Tickers) which are later
passed to API_query function.
- Cleaned up API_query function
- 
Current functions being used are as follows:
inbox.py - Checks the inbox for new messages. 
sendMail.py - Send message to list of users. Main function for sending price alerts.
API_query.py - Function used to query crypto currency data from coin market cap API. 
Function returns json object --> parsed --> converted to float(coinPrice)
crypto_alert.py - This is currently the main program. Ideally everything will be called
from this program.

NEED TO DO
1.) Parse inbox object to identify who the message is from. This will be used to 
eventually update database as well as identify who to send message to.
2.) Eventually set up a Postgress db and log all queries to db
3.) Figure out how to organize user info. and requests

COMPLETED
- Figured out how to bundle api calls/queries in order to retrieve multiple tickers within 
each call. 
- Learned about postgreSQL databases. 

NEED TO DO
1.) Refine the API_query.py function to take in new "multi-ticker" argument and return 
the price of each ticker. This will eventually get used for step --> 2)
2.) With updated API_query function, update a db with a timestamp and price for each ticker.
Database will query an API request 333 times per day (current limit) and update.
3.) Eventually the program will need to update a "ticker tracking list" based on user
requests. For all ticker not found in database --> add to ticker list --> add to database.
4.) Update the sendMail function to send price updates from queries to the database.
